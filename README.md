# open-source-automated-vehicle-data-analysis
This project now include two open-source datasets ([OpenACC](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/9702c950-c80f-4d2f-982f-44d06ea0009f), [CATS Lab dataset](https://github.com/CATS-Lab)) and two confidential datasets (TRC dataset and Beijing Test dataset) . 
The code contains how to clean, class, and initially regress these data to a linear car-following model.
